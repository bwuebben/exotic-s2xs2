This is a partial-results paper. It develops the specified filling
W(+1,−1;0,0), its complete fundamental-group presentation, structural
reductions, and geometric models. The final filling question is open;
the exotic homeomorphism conclusions are conditional.

Sections 17 and 18 add a proposed Lagrangian-torus capacity obstruction,
a simply connected comparison, and a conditional handle-surgery argument
for symplectic homology. These additions await independent mathematical
verification, as indicated on the first page. This working revision has
not replaced the October 16 arXiv manuscript.

Build from this directory with `latexmk -pdf main.tex`. The figures and
bibliography are included in the source. No ancillary script is needed
for the build.

The two scripts in `anc/` check finite identities and other printed
algebraic data. They require only the Python 3 standard library and do
not determine whether the filled group is trivial or verify the new
symplectic arguments.
